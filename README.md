# Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts used in various rooms on platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and CTF competitions. The purpose of this repository is to provide you with a valuable resource of scripts that can aid in solving challenges and automating certain tasks.

Unlike the CTF repository, this repository focuses solely on the scripts used in different rooms. It does not include complete write-ups or solutions to the challenges. Instead, the emphasis is on sharing the scripts themselves along with detailed explanations of their functionality and usage.

Each script is documented in its accompanying README file, providing insights into how it was developed, any improvements made, and how it can be effectively utilized to tackle specific challenges. If a script was initially sourced from another developer, the README will outline the enhancements and modifications made to it.

By exploring the scripts in this repository, you can gain a deeper understanding of the techniques used in various rooms and learn how to optimize and develop scripts to suit your own needs. It serves as a valuable reference and learning tool for aspiring ethical hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts.

### Please note that the scripts provided here are intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and ethically.

Happy hacking!
