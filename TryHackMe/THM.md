# TryHackMe Rooms Scripts

This folder contains a collection of scripts used in a specific TryHackMe room. The scripts are designed to aid in solving the challenges presented in the room by automating certain tasks or providing helpful functionality.

Each script is tailored to address a specific aspect of the room, such as enumeration, privilege escalation, or vulnerability exploitation. They have been carefully crafted and tested to enhance your experience and streamline the process of completing the challenges.

The scripts are accompanied by detailed explanations and instructions in their respective README files, allowing you to understand their purpose, required dependencies, and how to use them effectively. While the scripts themselves are provided, the write-ups or solutions to the challenges are not included to preserve the learning experience for other users.

Feel free to explore and utilize these scripts as you progress through the TryHackMe rooms. They are here to assist you in your learning journey and make the process more efficient and enjoyable.

Happy hacking!
